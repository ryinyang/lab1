		<p>This application is a tool to track how much students study. It helps students by breaking down study times into small, bitesized intervals of intense study. The application tracks these study intervals, reporting to the user the amount of study done in a day. As the student uses the app, the app records statistics on how much studying was done and what times are good study times.</p>
